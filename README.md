Details of Each Column in the Lung Cancer Dataset
GENDER: The gender of the patient, important as certain lung cancer risks and outcomes can vary by gender.
AGE: Age of the patient, a primary risk factor since lung cancer incidence increases with age.
SMOKING: Smoking status of the patient. Smoking is the most significant risk factor for lung cancer.
YELLOW_FINGERS: Indicates the presence of yellow staining on fingers, which might be associated with smoking or other conditions.
ANXIETY: Reports if the patient suffers from anxiety, which some studies suggest could be linked with cancer symptoms or risk behaviors like smoking.
PEER_PRESSURE: Whether peer pressure influences the patient's smoking habits, potentially affecting lung cancer risk.
CHRONIC_DISEASE: Indicates the presence of any chronic disease, which can complicate or be linked with lung cancer.
FATIGUE: Fatigue can be both a symptom of lung cancer and a common complaint in many other conditions.
ALLERGY: Reports any allergies, which are generally not directly linked to lung cancer but can affect overall respiratory health.
WHEEZING: Wheezing could indicate obstructed airways, often seen in lung cancer patients.
ALCOHOL_CONSUMING: Alcohol consumption habits, which can be a risk factor for various cancers, though less directly for lung cancer.
COUGHING: Persistent coughing is a typical symptom observed in lung cancer patients.
SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH: Often occurs as lung cancer progresses and tumors affect lung capacity.
SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY: Difficulty swallowing can be a symptom of lung cancer, particularly if tumors are pressing against the esophagus.
CHEST_PAIN: Chest pain in lung cancer patients can arise from tumor growth in the chest cavity.
LUNG_CANCER: Indicates the presence or absence of lung cancer (YES or NO), used as the dependent variable in studies or predictive models.
